# Roadmap: Datadog & Dynatrace  

This roadmap is designed to guide you step by step in learning and practicing **Datadog** and **Dynatrace** for real-world DevOps and SRE use cases.

## üìå Datadog Roadmap  

### 1. Fundamentals  
- Understand what Datadog is and where it fits in observability.  
- Learn about Metrics, Traces, and Logs.  
- Get familiar with the **Datadog Agent** and its role.  

### 2. Setup & Installation  
- Sign up for a free Datadog account.  
- Install the **Datadog Agent** on:  
  - Linux / Windows VM.  
  - Docker container.  
  - Kubernetes cluster (DaemonSet).  
- Validate installation by checking metrics in the dashboard.  

### 3. Core Features  
- **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Servers, containers, cloud resources.  
- **APM (Application Performance Monitoring)**: Trace requests across microservices.  
- **Log Management**: Collect and analyze logs (e.g., Nginx, AWS CloudWatch).  
- **Dashboards & Visualizations**: Create custom dashboards for metrics.  
- **Alerts & Notifications**: Set monitors with thresholds and anomaly detection.  

### 4. Cloud Integrations  
- Integrate **AWS (CloudWatch, RDS, Lambda, EKS)**.  
- Explore integrations with **Azure / GCP** if available.  
- Connect CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions).  

### 5. Advanced Usage  
- Use **Synthetic Monitoring** (simulate user requests).  
- Enable **Security Monitoring** (threat detection).  
- Explore **RUM (Real User Monitoring)** for frontend apps.  
- Implement **cost optimization** with Datadog billing insights.  

### 6. Best Practices  
- Standardize dashboards across environments.  
- Use tags for organizing services.  
- Combine logs, metrics, and traces for root cause analysis.

## üìå Dynatrace Roadmap  

### 1. Fundamentals  
- Understand Dynatrace‚Äôs **Full-Stack Observability** approach.  
- Learn about **OneAgent** and how it auto-discovers applications.  
- Get familiar with the **Davis AI Engine** for root cause detection.  

### 2. Setup & Installation  
- Create a Dynatrace account (SaaS or Managed).  
- Install **OneAgent** on:  
  - Linux / Windows VM.  
  - Kubernetes cluster.  
- Connect Dynatrace with your **AWS account** for cloud monitoring.  

### 3. Core Features  
- **Application Performance Monitoring**: Auto-discovered traces & services.  
- **Infrastructure Monitoring**: VMs, containers, Kubernetes pods.  
- **Synthetic Monitoring**: Simulate and test application performance.  
- **Dashboards & Management Zones**: Organize data by team or environment.  
- **Alerting Profiles**: Configure intelligent alerts using Davis AI.  

### 4. Cloud & DevOps Integrations  
- Connect Dynatrace with **AWS, Azure, GCP**.  
- Integrate with Kubernetes for pod-level visibility.  
- Connect CI/CD pipelines for release tracking.  

### 5. Advanced Usage  
- Use **Session Replay** for frontend troubleshooting.  
- Monitor **business KPIs** alongside technical metrics.  
- Automate remediation with Dynatrace + Ansible / Terraform.  
- Explore **Graffiti & DQL (Dynatrace Query Language)**.  

### 6. Best Practices  
- Organize monitoring with **management zones**.  
- Leverage **auto-tagging** for microservices.  
- Use AI-driven **problem detection** instead of static thresholds.  
- Regularly audit monitored entities to avoid noise.
